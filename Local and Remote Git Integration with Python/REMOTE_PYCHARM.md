### All instructions were tested in PyCharm Pro
### Some functions may work differently in other IDEs

1. Create the project locally
2. Under the Git options, select manage remotes
3. Go the highest level of the remote repository and copy the URL
4. Add the remote repository URL and name it origin
5. Select the login assist option and enter your credentials
6. Ideally, select the master branch and click on the pull option
7. If the pull has an issue, clone the repository on Azure DevOps

### Creating a new branch, new files, and code reviews
1. Always create a new branch when working on a new feature
2. Creating a new file is fine, but document it thoroughly and avoid adding to main
3. Depending on the project and who has worked on which part of the code, a code review may be necessary
